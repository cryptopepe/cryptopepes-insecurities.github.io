  <h1>Firefox and Chromium Security</h1>

  <p>
    Chromium is far more secure than Firefox. Firefox's sandboxing and exploit mitigations are much poorer than Chromium's.
    This article is not blindly hating on Firefox but is a factual analysis of its weaknesses.
  </p>

  <h2 id="sandboxing"><a href="#sandboxing">Firefox's Sandbox</a></h2>

  <p>
    Sandboxing is a technique used to isolate certain programs to prevent a vulnerability in them from compromising
    the rest of the system. All common browsers nowadays include a sandbox. The browser splits itself up into different
    processes (e.g. the content process, GPU process, etc.) and sandboxes them individually. It is very important
    that a browser uses a sandbox. Otherwise, any exploit in the browser can be used to take over the rest of the system.
    With a sandbox, they would need to chain their exploit with an additional sandbox escape vulnerability. <br>
    <br>
    However, sandboxes are not black and white. Just having a sandbox doesn't do much if it's full of holes.
    Firefox's sandbox is quite weak for the following reasons: <br>

    <ul class="ullist">
      <li class="lilist">
        Firefox's <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox">sandboxing</a> lacks any <a
        href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation">site isolation</a>. Site isolation runs
        every website inside its own sandbox so that malware in one website cannot access the data from another.
        Mozilla is working on this with <a
        href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Project_Fission">Project Fission</a> but it is still a WIP. The sandbox is currently
        only focused on isolating the browser as a whole from the rest of the OS and even that is still not great.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        Excluding the issue
        of site isolation, only the Firefox sandbox on Windows is similar to <a
        href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md">Chromium's</a> but even then,
        it <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=win32k">lacks</a> <a
        href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/11/breaking-chain.html">win32k lockdown</a>. Win32k is a set of
        dangerous system calls in the NT kernel that expose a lot of attack surface and has been the result of many
        vulnerabilities before. Microsoft aimed to lessen this risk by introducing a feature that <a
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-process_mitigation_system_call_disable_policy?redirectedfrom=MSDN">
        allows a program to block access to these syscalls, massively reducing attack surface</a>. Chromium implemented this in 2016
        to strengthen the sandbox but Firefox has yet to follow suit.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        The sandboxing on other platforms is much worse and the Linux sandbox even has unfixed critical sandbox escape issues such as through the
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1129492">X11 server</a> that go back as far as 5 years. The problem with X11
        is that it <a href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">
        doesn't implement any GUI isolation</a>. This makes it <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/42320.html">very easy to escape sandboxes</a>.
        Chromium resolves this issue by only exposing X11 to the GPU process so the renderer process (the process in which websites are loaded)
        cannot access them.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        The issues with the Linux sandbox also go far beyond X11. One example is that
        there is <a
        href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox/Process_model#GPU_Process">no sandboxing at all for the GPU process</a>.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        Another example
        is that the seccomp filter is weaker; for example, there is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1302711">
        very little ioctl filtering</a> and <a
        href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a5cb1a40413ebfb37e68bc8961e5a46467f06d14/security/sandbox/linux/SandboxFilter.cpp#1125">
        only TTY-related ioctls are blocked</a>. Ioctl is a massive kernel attack surface that comprises of hundreds of different syscalls.
        It is somewhat similar to NT's Win32k. Android <a href="https://kernsec.org/files/lss2015/vanderstoep.pdf">implemented ioctl filtering in its application sandbox</a>
        for this exact reason. Chromium allows only a few ioctls which reduces attack surface a considerable amount.
        These issues are only a few examples and there are a lot more issues with the sandbox.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        On Android, Firefox <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565196">does not have a sandbox at all beyond
        the OS app sandbox</a> unlike Chromium which uses the <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/service-element#isolated"><code>isolatedProcess</code>
        feature</a> along with a more strict seccomp-bpf filter.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="exploit-mitigations"><a href="#exploit-mitigations">Firefox's Exploit Mitigations</a></h2>

  <p>
    Exploit mitigations are self-explanatory. They mitigate certain types of exploits. Firefox lacks many important mitigations
    while Chromium generally excels in this area.

    <ul class="ullist">
      <li class="lilist">
        Firefox lacks a hardened memory allocator. Firefox currently uses <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/memory/build/mozjemalloc.cpp">
        mozjemalloc</a> which is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc">jemalloc</a>. Jemalloc is a performance-oriented
        memory allocator. It doesn't focus on security which makes it <a
        href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/Argyoudis/BH_US_12_Argyroudis_Exploiting_the_%20jemalloc_Memory_%20Allocator_Slides.pdf">
        very friendly to exploitation</a>. Mozjemalloc does add on a few security features to jemalloc which is good but <a
        href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2019-August/013990.html">it is not enough to
        fix the issues present in the overall architecture of the allocator</a>. Chromium instead uses <a
        href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/allocator/partition_allocator/PartitionAlloc.md">
        PartitionAlloc</a> which is much more <a href="https://struct.github.io/partition_alloc.html">hardened</a> than mozjemalloc.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control-Flow Integrity</a> (CFI) is an exploit mitigation that aims to prevent
        code reuse attacks like ROP or JOP. A large portion of vulnerabilities are exploited using these techniques due to mitigations like NX
        making older techniques obsolete. Mozilla has been <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510629">planning to implement CFI for a while</a>
        but has yet to make much progress. On Linux and Android, Chromium <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity">uses Clang's
        forward-edge CFI</a> and on Windows, they <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md#Process-mitigation-policies">
        use Control Flow Guard</a>.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        All common browsers include a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT compiler</a> to improve performance.
        There is an inherent security hole in JIT however and that is the requirement of memory that is both writable and executable (a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX">W^X</a> violation). Due to not wanting massive security issues while also wanting
        better performance, browsers have adopted JIT hardening techniques in an attempt to make exploiting JIT security issues much harder.
        In <a href="https://github.com/struct/research/blob/master/Attacking_Clientside_JIT_Compilers_Paper.pdf">this study</a>, it
        shows that Chromium's JIT engine has far better mitigations than Firefox's.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        A very basic exploit technique is simply to find a way to execute the attackers own malicious code either by loading
        a malicious library on disk or by dynamically modifying executable code in memory. <a
        href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/">Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG) and Code Integrity
        Guard (CIG) mitigate both of these issues</a>. Chromium <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md#Process-mitigation-policies">
        enables these by default</a>, but Firefox lacks both <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1381050">ACG</a> and <a
        href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1378417">
        CIG</a>. Technically, this is only a issue on Windows but that's only because other operating systems lack these mitigations in the first place.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        There are many more issues than these though but this article doesn't need to be a full novel. You can look through
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home">Mozilla's own bug tracker</a> for more examples.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="miscellaneous"><a href="#miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a></h2>

  <p>
    Firefox <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Oxidation">does have some parts written in Rust, a memory-safe language</a>,
    but the majority of the browser is still written in memory-unsafe languages so this isn't anything substantial and
    <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety">Chromium is working on switching to memory-safe
    languages too</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Firefox also uses <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-webassembly/">RLBox</a> but this
    is only used to sandbox a single library, Graphite and again, is not anything substantial.
